TODO

1. Change POST call to GET call for find flights
2. User management and entity genearation on the client side could have been disabled during the base project generation but hidden out from the UI from simplicity.


Monotith application for a Aireline passenger booking site. 

This was developed/migrated in JHipster from the base codebase referred in the book Spring Microservivces by Rajesh RV from pakt publishing. [ https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/spring-microservices ]

With this project as a baseline, Idea is to use JHIPSTER provided framework using Spring cloud to migrate existing monolith into micro-services application.
