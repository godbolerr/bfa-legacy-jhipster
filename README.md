1. Change POST call to GET call for find flights

Monotith application for a Aireline passenger booking site. 

This was developed/migrated in JHipster from the base codebase referred in the book Spring Microservivces by Rajesh RV from pakt publishing. [ https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/spring-microservices ]

With this project as a baseline, Idea is to use JHIPSTER provided framework using Spring cloud to migrate existing monolith into micro-services application.
